consumer_alert is a iPhone application to track the consumer products recall information from multiple Federal government agencies.

Technically this application is a RSS feed reader speciallized for some government data feeds, including
	National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
	http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/rss/feeds/rss_recalls_C.xml
	http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/rss/feeds/rss_recalls_T.xml
	http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/rss/feeds/rss_recalls_V.xml
	Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
	http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ContactFDA/StayInformed/RSSFeeds/Recalls/rss.xml
	Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)

	http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prereloutdoor.xml

The RSS reader relies on the Objective-C XML parser "touchXML" (information can be found at http://foobarpig.com/iphone/touchxml-installation-guide.html)
Note: the latest touchXML source code has already been placed under "classes". No need to download any more.

This application is meant to be published as free app in Apple appstore, and it has support of two types of advertisement mechanism:
the first is through AdMob (the integration was before Google aquired Admob, so it might be need to updated. Check the "ProgrammaicAdViewController")
In this project, we also are experimenting our own advertisement publishing. The purpose is to promote other products and as well develop our own location based commercial ads-service.
